# Expense Tracker (React)


A modern and minimalistic Expense Tracker built with **React**, using **functional components**, **React Hooks**, and the **Context API** for state management.  
This project is a React-based version of my [vanilla JS Expense Tracker](https://github.com/abhisheksi-ngh/my-expense-manage).

> Manage your daily expenses smartly with an easy-to-use and responsive interface.
